        so in the LAB color space, the values for L A and B are not the same range
        The Lightness Channel ranges from 0 - 100 for some reason
        A and B range from -127 - +127 like normal 
        
        so to normalize a range of 0 -100 into -1 to 1,  i can subtract 50 so the range is now -50 to 50,  then divide by 50 (bruh!)

        Also VERY IMPORTANT, the image (original) was in RGB, so we use rgb to gray function

        the resnet requires a 3 channel input so we convert the gray image to rgb again
        
        natra cheating huncha because train garda colored image bata feature extract garna sikcha but practical case ma ta color hudaina
        soooo
        also also also, skimage resize use garda internally normalize huncha value so, at the end we turn the rgb values back to 0-255 range
